PROJECT TITLE: Motivational Chatbot
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To provide users with motivational and inspirational quotes/sayings based on context.
VERSION or DATE: 16 November 2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: We started this project by looking back at our Magpie Assignment and working off of it to make a different chatbot
AUTHORS: Aanya Varanasi and Aryan Jadhav
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Run the program and type as you please. Whatever you say will initiate a response by the chatbot. The chatbot will need you to type in words, instead of leaving it blank, in order for it to give back an appropriate response. 
PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS: Our program has many methods but only two public ones. There is a getResponse(String statement) and a getGreeting() that will return context responses and greetings. Our other methods our private that find keywords in statements, transform statements for custom made responses. We used the basic logic for our context responses where multiple conditionals check for certain keywords in a statement and that the statement's length is greater than 0 and responded accordingly.
